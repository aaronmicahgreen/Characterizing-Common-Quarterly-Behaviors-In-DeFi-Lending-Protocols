The code to compute the clusters for the paper "Characterizing Common Quarterly Behaviors in DeFi Lending Protocols" and to create the figures is found in the file "userClusteringForMARBLE2023.rmd".

The data is too large to be included in this repository, and it comes from three different sources. The bulk of the data comes from The Graph. This includes all the transaction data. Additional data from AmberData and DeFiLlama are included for a couple of features, such as whether an account is a smart contract or EOA, and whether a coin is a stable coin. The data collection code for data from The Graph is included, as that data is freely available online. This code also includes the collection of data from AmberData, but that portion requires an API key which is not freely available.
